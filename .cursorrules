# Cursor Rules for mdsync Repository

## Git Operations
- **NEVER commit changes automatically** - Always ask the user before running `git commit` or `git push`
- **NEVER push to remote** without explicit user permission
- Always show what changes will be committed before asking for permission
- Use `git status` and `git diff` to show changes before committing

## Code Changes
- Always explain what changes are being made and why
- Test changes when possible before suggesting commits
- Ask for confirmation before making significant changes to core functionality

## File Operations
- Be careful with file moves, renames, and deletions
- Always verify file paths and operations
- Ask before overwriting existing files

## Documentation
- Update documentation when making functional changes
- Keep README and setup guides current
- Document new features and changes

## Security
- Never commit sensitive information (API keys, tokens, passwords)
- Always use environment variables or config files for secrets
- Ensure .gitignore is properly configured

## Testing
- Test functionality after making changes
- Verify that examples and documentation still work
- Check for breaking changes before suggesting commits

## Sync Operations
- **NEVER sync to Confluence automatically** - Always ask the user before running any `mdsync` command that would sync to Confluence
- **NEVER sync to Google Docs automatically** - Always ask the user before running any `mdsync` command that would sync to Google Docs
- Only perform sync operations when explicitly requested by the user
- Always explain what will be synced and where before proceeding
- Use `--diff` flag to show changes before syncing when appropriate
